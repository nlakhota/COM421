            <div class="section-card">
                <h2><img src="files/icons/cutter.gif" alt="Getting Started" class="icon"> Getting Started</h2>
                <h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
                <p>If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the Hawk Card Homepage. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services.</p>
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin Library or request materials through interlibrary loan.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
                <p>Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources." Try logging in, and clicking on that link.</p>
                
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="images/research2.jpg" alt="Library Services icon leading to library search website">
                    <p class="caption">The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access most resources without reentering your login information.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Once you are at the library website, you will see a variety of search options available on the left-hand navigation bar.</p>
                <p>The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2><img src="files/icons/calc.gif" alt="Timeline" class="icon"> Research Timelines</h2>
                <h3>Formulating a timeline</h3>
                <p>It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource for your paper:</p>
                
                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project < Remaining time before deadline</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Let's unpack some of those terms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time to obtain resource:</strong> How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan? -or- How long will it take for you to physically obtain the resource?</li>
                    <li><strong>Time to read resource:</strong> How long will it take you to read the book or article? Are you at a point in your project where you must begin to write if you want to finish on time?</li>
                    <li><strong>Time to integrate resource into your project:</strong> Even if you are able to read the resource, do you have enough time to identify pertinent information and incorporate that information into your project?</li>
                    <li><strong>Remaining time before deadline:</strong> How much time is left before you must turn in your project?</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Being Realistic: Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting your precious time if you try to obtain resources that you can't possibly hope to read within your research timeline.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2><img src="files/icons/ladder.gif" alt="Case Study" class="icon"> Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h2>
                <p>Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been assigned a literature review and research paper for a graduate course. She's decided to research the development of technical communication as a field between the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War II.</p>
                <p>Her first move is to begin researching by logging into myIIT and searching for articles using scholarly databases like EBSCO and JSTOR. After conducting some research, she finds several articles that are pertinent to her search topic, but are not available as a .pdf download through those databases.</p>
                <p>Having conducted research projects before, she knows that she need not write down her timeline, but she decides to set reasonable goals and record them in her Google calendar so that she has an idea of when certain elements of her project should be completed.</p>

                <h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
                <p>Occasionally, you will notice that some articles are not available for download as a .pdf file through a journal or academic search engine.</p>
                
                <div class="image-container">

                    <p class="caption">For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL</p>
                </div>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Your myILL account requires a separate setup from your myIIT account, so you will need to register before you are able to request an article. Think of myILL as asking a friend to make a copy of an article for you, because that is essentially what you are doing.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2><img src="files/icons/wrench.gif" alt="Libraries" class="icon"> Local Libraries</h2>
                <p>There are two types of local libraries that may contain your resources:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Other university libraries belonging to I-Share</li>
                    <li>Public libraries</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>Being Realistic: Don't waste your research time by making the trip to a library only to find out it is closed for break or you are not allowed to browse the stacks as a non-student. When in doubt, call first.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section-card">
                <h2><img src="files/icons/calc.gif" alt="Web Resources" class="icon"> Internet Resources</h2>
                <h3>Some resources to consider</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Public domain writings</li>
                    <li>Resources licensed under Creative Commons</li>
                    <li>Media files such as video, audio, and images</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Using Web Resources for Research</h3>
                <p>Some web resources can help you find additional resources, such as the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Scholar:</strong> Allows you to search for scholarly articles and view which articles are cited by other articles</li>
                    <li><strong>Google Books:</strong> Allows you to view a preview of a book, or in some cases, the entire book, including the references section</li>
                    <li><strong>Web of Science:</strong> Similar to Google Scholar, but for scientific papers</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="info-box">
                    <p>If you're stuck when researching a topic in Technical Communication, try searching for a special issue, yearbook, or edited volume on your topic. Collections such as these offer you a wealth of resources and represent a snapshot of collective scholarship on a topic.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
